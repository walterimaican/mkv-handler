# mkv-handler

A simple program to walk user through various MKV operations. Wraps around [MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/index.html) and [subshift](https://github.com/ngerritsen/subshift#readme).

I am adding functionality to it as needed. As a result, this program is far from being a full wrapper (and most likely will never reach that point).
